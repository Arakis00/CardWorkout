# CardWorkout2
A deck of cards exercise application for Android (Java).

# Description
This program is intended to be used for a quick exercise/cardio session when minimal equipment is available. You draw randomly from a full deck of 52 cards until all cards are exhausted. Each card suit corresponds to its' own exercise. Each card value corresponds to the number of reps to be performed. 

# Notes
This is basically a port of the cardWorkout1 repository for iOS that I have on here.  I switched it over to Android when I switched phones since I actually use this program on ocassion.

# TODO list
-Make exercises editable since there are times nothing is around to perform pullups on.

-Add different tiers of difficulty to make the session harder (examples: make face cards act as multipliers, add jokers and assign something difficult, double all repetition counts, etc.)

-Port over to Android Studio since the Eclipse APK is no longer officially supported.
