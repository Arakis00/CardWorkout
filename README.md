# CardWorkout2
A deck of cards exercise application for Android (Java).

# Description
This program is intended to be used for a quick exercise/cardio session when minimal equipment is available. You draw randomly from a full deck of 52 cards until all cards are exhausted. Each card suit corresponds to its' own exercise. Each card value corresponds to the number of reps to be performed. 

# Notes
This is basically a port of the cardWorkout1 repository for iOS that I have on here.  I switched it over to Android when I switched phones since I actually use this program on ocassion.
